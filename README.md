# Papa Ekow Armah â€” Financial Planning and Analysis Project Repository

## What this repository contains
This repository includes projects and files I have worked on as a Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&A) analyst. Each project is based on real business scenarios where I have:  
- Analyzed gross profit by branch, product category, and vendor.  
- Created monthly revenue forecasts using past sales data and seasonal patterns.  
- Built pricing models to help guide margin optimization and vendor price decisions.  
- Automated financial dashboards that are used in leadership meetings.  
- Written SQL queries to extract, clean, and prepare financial and sales data.  
- Used Python scripts to automate reports and forecasting tasks.

## How these projects have been used in practice
- The gross profit analysis helped explain unexpected drops in profitability across different branches and product lines.  
- Revenue forecasting models helped predict branch-level sales with a margin of error of less than five percent.  
- Pricing models were used as support during vendor negotiations, leading to better price terms.  
- Power BI dashboards replaced manual reporting, saving over 80 percent of reporting time each month.  
- SQL queries are part of regular data pulls from our enterprise resource planning system.  
- Python automation has been used to refresh data models and send reports on a schedule without manual input.

## Why I built this repository
Every file and project here was built to solve a business problem. These models and reports have been used to explain why financial numbers change, to plan for future performance, and to reduce manual work. This repository is where I keep the work I am proud of, and I will continue to add to it as I complete new projects.
